微软计算机词典对 `control` 的解释有两个：

> **其一**：Management of a computer and its processing abilities so as to maintain order as tasks and activities are carried out. Control applies to measures designed to ensure error-free actions carried out at the right time and in the right order relative to other data-handling or hardware-based activities. In reference to **hardware**, control of system operations can reside in a data pathway called **a control bus**. In reference to **software**, control refers to program instructions that manage data-handling tasks. 

> **其二**： In a graphical user interface, an object on the screen that can be manipulated by the user to perform an action. The most common controls are **buttons**, which allow the user to select options, and **scroll bars**, which allow the user to move through a document or position text in a window.
