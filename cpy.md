学习这件事真就别怕麻烦，以为 `copy` 没什么好学的，是人都认识，缩写也很好记：`cpy`，但在研习copy 这个动作的具体英文解释时，还真的有收获。

比如，偶遇了很久没见到的`duplicate`，如果让你我用英文去口头解释 `copy` 这个动作，真的那么容易吗？包括`reproduce`也用的很传神对不对。从`输出者`的角度去学习输入的信息，增加一个视角，视界立马不一样。

> To **duplicate** information and **reproduce** it in another part of a document, in a different file or memory location, or in a different medium. A copy operation can affect data ranging from a single character to large segments of text, a graphics image, or from one to many data files. Text and graphics, for example, can be copied to another part of a document, to the computer’s memory (by means of a temporary storage facility such as the Windows or Macintosh Clipboard), or to a different file. Similarly, files can be copied from one disk or directory to another, and data can be copied from the screen to a printer or to a data file. In most cases, a copy procedure leaves the original information in place.(**微软计算机词典**)

> **cut and paste**: A procedure in which the computer acts as an electronic combination of scissors and glue for reorganizing a document or for compiling a document from different sources. In cut and paste, the portion of a document to be moved is **selected**, **removed** to storage in memory or on disk, and then **reinserted** into the same or a different document.

> **move**: A command or an instruction to **transfer** information from one location to another. Depending on the operation involved, a move can affect data in a computer’s memory or it can affect text or a graphical image in a data file. In programming, for example, a move instruction might transfer a single value from one memory location to another. In applications, on the other hand, a move command might relocate a paragraph of text or all or part of a graphic from one place in a document to another. Unlike a copy procedure, which duplicates information, a move indicates that information either is or **can be deleted from its original location.**
