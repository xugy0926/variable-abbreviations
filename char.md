## character

character 的缩写形式是前四个字母，非常好记: `char`。
需要额外注意的是 character 的首字母 ch 发音和 China 的 Ch 的发音不同，发/k/的音，完整音标为/'kærəktɚ/


【character】: 字符

> A letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol or control code that is represented to a computer by one unit—1 byte—of information. A **character is not necessarily visible,** either on the screen or on paper; a space, for example, is as much a character as is the letter a or any of the digits 0 through 9. Because computers must manage not only so-called printable characters but also the look (formatting) and transfer of electronically stored information, a character can additionally indicate a carriage return or a paragraph mark in a word-processed document. It can be a signal to sound a beep, begin a new page, or mark the end of a file.

【划重点】：character 不一定是可视的，比如空格(space)也算是一个character。

【character code】字符编码

> A specific code that represents a particular character in a set, **such as the ASCII character set.** The character code for a given key depends on whether another key, such as Shift, is pressed at the same time. For example, pressing the A key alone normally generates the character code for a lowercase a. Pressing Shift plus the A key normally generates the character code for an uppercase A

【ASCII】美国国家信息交换标准码
>  Acronym for **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**. A coding scheme using 7 or 8 bits that assigns numeric values to up to 256 characters, including letters, numerals, punctuation marks, control characters, and other symbols. ASCII was developed in 1968 to standardize data transmission among disparate hardware and software systems and is built into most minicomputers and all PCs. ASCII is divided into two sets: 128 characters (standard ASCII) and an additional 128 (extended ASCII)

【control character】

> In computing and telecommunication, a **control character** or **non-printing character** is a code point (a number) in a character set, that **does not represent a written symbol**. They are used as in-band signaling to cause effects other than the addition of a symbol to the text. All other characters are mainly printing, printable, or graphic characters, except perhaps for the "space" character
