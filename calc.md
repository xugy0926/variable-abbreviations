> **微软计算机词典**: Broadly, any device that **performs arithmetic operations on numbers**. Sophisticated calculators can be programmed for certain functions and can store values in memory, but they differ from computers in several ways: they have a fixed set of commands, they do not recognize text, they cannot retrieve values stored in a data file, and they cannot find and use values generated by a program such as a spreadsheet.

> **Bilingual E-C Computer Dictionary**: A device that is especially suitable for performing arithmetic operations, but that **requires human intervention** to alter its stored program, if any, and to initiate each operation or sequence of operations.
