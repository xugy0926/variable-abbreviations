## instance

instance 本意作为可数名词大多情况下指的是 “例子” ，比如 for example 近似等于 for instance, “举个栗子吧：

其英英解释为：
> **instance**: a particular situation, event or fact, especially an example of something that happens generally

例句：
> There have been several instances of violence at the school.

在编程学习过程中，大多数资料和文献会把 instance 翻译为 “实例”，微软计算机词典对`instance`解释如下: 

> An object, in object-oriented programming, in relation to the class to which it belongs. For example, an object **myList** that belongs to a class **List** is an instance of the class **List**.

比如，MDN 在介绍数组的 [length 属性][1] 时提到：

> The **length property** of an object which is an **instance** of type Array sets or returns the number of elements in that array.

`instance` 的简写取其前四个字母 ”inst“
